Gears is a theme for TextMate's Web Preview, which is used, for example, to
display RDoc information. Take a look at a screenshot

Installation
------------

You can install this bundle in TextMate by opening the preferences and going to
the bundles tab. After installation it will be automatically updated for you.

The next time you open a TextMate Web Preview, for example, when browsing
RDoc entries, you can select 'Gears' from the translucent theme picker.

Enjoy!
